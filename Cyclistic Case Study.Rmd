Converting ride_id and rideable_type to character so that they can stack correctly
```{r}
D2020_07 <- mutate(D2020_07, start_station_id = as.character(start_station_id),
                  end_station_id = as.character(end_station_id))
D2020_08 <- mutate(D2020_08, start_station_id = as.character(start_station_id),
                  end_station_id = as.character(end_station_id))
D2020_09 <- mutate(D2020_09, start_station_id = as.character(start_station_id),
                  end_station_id = as.character(end_station_id))
D2020_10 <- mutate(D2020_10, start_station_id = as.character(start_station_id),
                  end_station_id = as.character(end_station_id))
D2020_11 <- mutate(D2020_11, start_station_id = as.character(start_station_id),
                  end_station_id = as.character(end_station_id))
D2020_12 <- mutate(D2020_12, start_station_id = as.character(start_station_id),
                  end_station_id = as.character(end_station_id))
D2021_01 <- mutate(D2021_01, start_station_id = as.character(start_station_id),
                  end_station_id = as.character(end_station_id))
D2021_02 <- mutate(D2021_02, start_station_id = as.character(start_station_id),
                  end_station_id = as.character(end_station_id))
D2021_03 <- mutate(D2021_03, start_station_id = as.character(start_station_id),
                  end_station_id = as.character(end_station_id))
D2021_04 <- mutate(D2021_04, start_station_id = as.character(start_station_id),
                  end_station_id = as.character(end_station_id))
D2021_05 <- mutate(D2021_05, start_station_id = as.character(start_station_id),
                  end_station_id = as.character(end_station_id))
D2021_06 <- mutate(D2021_06, start_station_id = as.character(start_station_id),
                  end_station_id = as.character(end_station_id))
```
Stacking all indiviual data frames into one big data frame
```{r}
all_trips <- bind_rows(D2020_07, D2020_08, D2020_09, D2020_10, D2020_11,
                       D2020_12, D2021_01, D2021_02, D2021_03, D2021_04,
                       D2021_05, D2021_06)
```
Cleaning up and adding data for further analysis:
```{r}
colnames(all_trips)  #List of column names
nrow(all_trips)  #How many rows are in data frame?
dim(all_trips)  #Dimensions of the data frame?
head(all_trips)  #See the first 6 rows of data frame.  Also tail(all_trips)
str(all_trips)  #See list of columns and data types (numeric, character, etc)
summary(all_trips)  #Statistical summary of data. Mainly for numerics

```
# Adding columns that list the date, month, day, and year of each ride
# This will allow us to aggregate ride data for each month, day, or year ... before completing these operations we could only aggregate at the ride level
```{r}
all_trips$date <- as.Date(all_trips$started_at) #The default format is yyyy-mm-dd
all_trips$month <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%m")
all_trips$day <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%d")
all_trips$year <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%Y")
all_trips$day_of_week <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%A")

```
# Adding a "ride_length" calculation to all_trips (in seconds)
```{r}
all_trips$ride_length <- difftime(all_trips$ended_at,all_trips$started_at)
```
# Converting "ride_length" from Factor to numeric so we can run calculations on the data
```{r}
is.factor(all_trips$ride_length)
all_trips$ride_length <- as.numeric(as.character(all_trips$ride_length))
is.numeric(all_trips$ride_length)

```
Removing bad data
```{r}
all_trips <- all_trips[!(all_trips$ride_length<0),]
```

Conducting descriptive analysis on ride_length (figures in seconds)
```{r}
mean(all_trips$ride_length) #straight average (total ride length / rides)
median(all_trips$ride_length) #midpoint number in the ascending array of ride lengths
max(all_trips$ride_length) #longest ride
min(all_trips$ride_length) #shortest ride

```
Comparing casual users and members
```{r}
aggregate(all_trips$ride_length ~ all_trips$member_casual, FUN = mean)
aggregate(all_trips$ride_length ~ all_trips$member_casual, FUN = median)
aggregate(all_trips$ride_length ~ all_trips$member_casual, FUN = max)
aggregate(all_trips$ride_length ~ all_trips$member_casual, FUN = min)

```
Comparing average ride time between casual and average users
```{r}
aggregate(all_trips$ride_length ~ all_trips$member_casual + all_trips$day_of_week, FUN = mean)
```
#Putting the days in the correct order
```{r}
all_trips$day_of_week <- ordered(all_trips$day_of_week, levels=c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"))
```
Trying the same code again, but with ordered days
```{r}
aggregate(all_trips$ride_length ~ all_trips$member_casual + all_trips$day_of_week, FUN = mean)
```
Analyzing ridership by type and weekday
```{r}
all_trips %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>%  #creates weekday field using wday()
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>%  #groups by usertype and weekday
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()							#calculates the number of rides and average duration 
  ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 		# calculates the average duration
  arrange(member_casual, weekday)		
```
Number of rides by rider type
```{r}
all_trips %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 
  arrange(member_casual, weekday)  %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = number_of_rides, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")

```
Average duration of rides by rider type
```{r}
all_trips %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 
  arrange(member_casual, weekday)  %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = average_duration, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```
```{r}

```
